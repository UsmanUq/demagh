### computationally semantic/linguistic representation of my brain in processing arabic.
I claim to speak 6 languages. 

not true obviously, but thats not the point. 

what is actually interesting is that whenever ive taken these languages up, I have excelled in grasping their vocabulary and sentence structure.  (dw, 6 bec i leave them after, the steep learning curve gets the best of us). 

To maintain that this is not an abnoxious and self-glazing statement, ive taken up this project with the aim to [over]analyze this hypotheses with my most 
recent linguistic obsession, arabic.

First step is to develop a corpus *(ooo fancy...)* of mappings my brain makes of arabic words to these expertly informed categories:

1. arabic_word *str*
2. english_meaning *str*
3. urdu_meaning *str*
4. personal_connotation *str* *feeling*
5. heaviness *dense/heavy* *below; likert scale rating of 1 (low) to 5 (high)*
6. sharpness *jagged vs round*
7. purity *cleanliness*
8. divinity *spiritual, religious connotation*
9. earthiness *grounded, earthy, *
10. emotion *other*

The corpus is in process and is regularly updated.

Enjoy!
